   <p class='control'>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
   <p class='pilot'>Radio confirmed, ground control.</p>
   <p class='control'>Solid copy, pilot. We thought we lost you in the gundark nest back there. What is the ship and crew casualty status?</p>
   <p class='pilot'>Barely made it out, we took heavy casualties and ship damage. Engines down. I think a gundark has boarded.</p>
   <p class='control'>Pilot, do you have any method of defense handy? We are sending Jedi backup, but if you can find a blaster or lightsaber you'll need to stall.</p>
   <p class='pilot'>We have some blasters, hopefully that will hold it off until help arrives.</p>
